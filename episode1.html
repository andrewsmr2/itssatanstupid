  </h2>
          <p style="color:white"> Rise and shine, losers.  Satan here. Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.  JK.  No eggs and bakey.  Let's see what we got on the menu- we got broken glass for breakfast.  So get your lazy butts out of bed, people, and go enjoy a nice bowl of broken glass.  Now I know some of you are new here so allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Satan and you are in hell.  I can see that some of you are confused and you're all like "why is it cold even though there are wildfires outside"- yeah, it's cold here.  I like it cold.  The dudes who wrote the bible got that wrong (amongst other things), it's not hot here.  I do not like the heat, people- I sweat easily and I'd just rather not deal- I'd rather it be cold.  So hence the temp.  But yeah- you're in hell.  Welcome to my humble abode, again my name is Satan- nice to meet ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.  Since I am a good host, I'm giving you a few minutes to wake up and acclimate. So enjoy it because as soon as I stop talking, the initiation begins.  What's initiation, you may ask?  Well, it starts with the locusts.  It's actually just the locusts, really.  I'm a softie- I said "just give em' one thing for initiation and call it a day".  I know y'all don't know what I'm talking about- so, we got locusts here but these aren't your average locusts, people.  They're revelations locusts.  God was the one who came up with the idea (people think God is really benevolent and kind but I know the guy, he's actually kind of a sick dude).  But I digress. Now this will be the only time you ever catch me giving God a compliment because it's no secret that I *literally* hate the guy's guts but I have to hand it to him- these locusts are a top of the line product.  I'll just let the bible speak for itself, here's a little tidbit from revelations, cue the Bible: </p>

          <p style="color:white"> "Locusts with the power of scorpions
(SCORPIONS, BITCHES)
will torture newcomers for 5 months.  The agony of their sting is like the sting of a scorpion.  Men will want to die but can't.  The locusts look like horses prepared for battle.  On their heads, they wear something like crowns of gold
(Ooh, fashion)
and their faces resemble human faces
(yikes- humans are not known for being the most beautiful species but okay, I guess that's why you went there).  
Their hair is like women's hair and their teeth are like lion's teeth.  They have breastplates like breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings is like the thundering of many horses & chariots rushing into battle".   </p>

          <p style="color:white"> So there you go, good job, God- you had one good idea.  Like I said, as soon as my daily podcast finishes airing today, you'll get to meet your locust friends and they're gonna sting you for 5 months and then that's it, initiation's over and honestly the whole process is actually good for your skin and your nervous system so I don't want to hear any crying or complaining, you big babies.   </p>

          <p style="color:white"> So this is my podcast.  I get to talk about whatever I want.  It's kind of like an alarm clock- I just start screamin' my thoughts in the early morning- oh my god my bull just did the cutest thing! Sorry, I got distracted- I get distracted easily, I'm a gemini.  For the newcomers, everyone here in hell gets a pet bull.  You're welcome.  But don't try to cuddle them, they are not friendly.  Well, mine is but that's because I'm the boss around here and I get to have nice things.  My bull's name is Frankie and he just put his head in my lap because he's beggin'- he wants some of my breakfast croissant.  But yeah, Frankie's friendly but none of the other bulls are friendly.  They act moreso as a security system.  You do have neighbors, there are other people in hell but you are not allowed to interact with each other because we all saw how well that went on the planet earth and I'm not dealin' with the drama, people. So the bulls keep you from leaving your house and they keep other people from approaching your houses.  Don't try to leave home because your bull will attack you.  Capeesh?  You may not like the setup but go ahead and tell someone who cares.  Now, where was I?</p>

          <p style="color:white"> I'm honestly getting a little tired of talking to you losers so I think I'm gonna sign off for the day. Final note to the newcomers, every day you get to listen to me sing a song.  Most living people don't know it but Satan is quite the chanteuse so here it is and you're welcome. 
            Today you are going to listen to me sing "no more tears *parentheses* enough is enough *parentheses* " by Barbara Streisand and Donna Summer.  Here goes- cue the music, DJ: </p>

          <p style="color:white"> "It's raining, it's pouring,
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years.
No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance.
We don't stand a chance.
I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover,
But he turned out to be like every other man.
Our love, our love.
Raining (raining),
Pouring (pouring),
There's nothing left for us here.
And we won't waste another tear.
Ah, yeah,
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it.
If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it.
Tell him to just get out,
Nothing left to talk about.
Pack his raincoat show him out,
Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough (is enough),
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no.
Enough is enough (is enough),
I want him out, I want him out that door now.

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover,
But he turned out to be like every other man.
Our love (I had no choice from the start),
Our love ,
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart),
Our love (Tearing us apart),
Our love, ooh.
Enough is enough (is enough),
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no.
Enough is enough (is enough),
I want him out, I want him out that door now.
Goodbye mister. Goodbye, goodbye mister.
Goodbye sugar.
No more tears.
No more tears.
No more tears.
I've had it. We've had it. You've had it. He's had it.
No more tears.
Is enough, is enough, is enough, is enough, is enough, is enough, is enough."
 </p>


          <p style="color:white"> That's all for today, folks.  Don't let the door hit ya where the dark lord split ya. </p>
