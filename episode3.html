  <p style="color:white"> Morning, stupid losers. Another beautiful day in the neighborhood. Get off your lazy tuckus and pull the blinds and look out your window. The sky is extra red and the air is extra smoky because the wildfires are nice and strong but the clouds are extra black, though- we might get an acid storm later. All in all a nice summer day. And you should get up and make the most of it. Oops I forgot you can't leave your houses, lol. Losers. </p>

  <p style="color:white"> Let's see, what should I talk about today. I guess I could respond to a few more emails. Bernadette. The lamps are not broken- they don't light up. They're not like planet earth lamps, they are hell lamps, they don't "create light".  This was a conscious design choice, babes- not all design choices make sense to people with no sense of style or revolution.  I know it's dark. I know you're having a hard time reading your magazine. But honestly sweetie, I wrote the magazine- its all rubbish. God- you know how when you look at something you wrote 2,000 years ago and you're just like sheesh, this is embarrassing- I don't even wanna look at it. I was young when I wrote it- it's not good, you're not missing out. Just watch some fox news, you'll be fine.  And there is also nothing wrong with your mirror- okay, Bernadette? Bernadette- plug your ears, I need to say something to everyone in hell except for you. You got your ears plugged?  Okay.  To everyone else: this bitch.  She writes me every day, "there's something wrong with my house, there's something wrong with my house".  Yeah, I know there's something wrong with your house, Bernadette. I'm the landlord, I've been there before. Ok Bernadette, you can unplug your ears. For the newcomers- you'll get mirrors after your first year of being here. It's my helliversary present to you- a little home decor. Every time you look in the mirror, you're going to see one of your biggest insecurities written out in text.  And it's fun because every time you look away then look back again, a new insecurity pops up.  It's like a magic 8 ball except mean, I love it. </p>

  <p style="color:white"> So. I was feeling a little bored yesterday.  And maybe some of you noticed your journals went missing for a little bit. Well, that's because I sent my demons out to get me some entertainment. Was it good entertainment? Meh- mixed bag.  Like, Brian- you were a little boring.  You're afraid of spiders and being forgotten. That's very predictable, Brian.  Come back when you're less boring.  Karen, I did enjoy reading yours and you're right- that was your fault.  Sasha, your dog doesn't miss you because he's dead, too.  And your 4th grade Sunday School teacher was actually right (I always get a kick out of it when the christians are right about stuff). Animals don't go to heaven (or hell) because they don't have souls. </p>

  <p style="color:white"> Alright, I'm gonna keep this short and sweet today. I got places to go, people to see, lives to ruin.  Oh, I do have one quick announcement.  As you all know by now, you each live in a 2 story house but you are confined to the ground floor of your homes.  Some of you have learned the hard way that if you try to go up the stairs, you will be electrocuted.  Lol.  Sorry bout it.  On the 2nd floor of each home lives a heavy footed demon that paces around all day and night.  And thanks for all the e-mails, people, but I know your homes are not soundproof, I designed them.  So, anyways.  My demons have mentioned to me that their jobs are a little boring, and I get it.  I would be bored, too, if all I did was stomp around all day and night and drop shit as soon as you losers fell asleep.  So I got each of them a pair of tap shoes and a bass guitar.  They're not exactly musically inclined, have fun with that byeeeeee. </p>

  <p style="color:white"> "Dear, I fear we're facing a problem.
  You love me no longer, I know and
  maybe there is nothing that I can do 
  to make you do.
  Mama tells me I shouldn't bother,
  That I ought to stick to another man.
  A man that surely deserves me,
  But I think you do.
  So I cry and I pray and I beg.
  Love me, love me,
  Say that you love me.
  Fool me, fool me,
  Go on and fool me.
  Love me, love me.
  Pretend that you love me.
  Leave me, leave me,
  Just say that you need me.
  So, I cry and I beg for you to
  Love me, love me,
  Say that you love me.
  Leave me, leave me,
  Just say that you need me.
  I can't care 'bout anything but you.
  Lately I have desperately pondered.
  Spent my nights awake and I wonder,
  What I could have done in another way
  To make you stay.
  Reason will not lead to solution,
  I will end up lost in confusion.
  I don't care if you really care,
  As long as you don't go.
  So I cry, I pray, and I beg.
  Love me, love me,
  Say that you love me.
  Fool me, fool me,
  Go on and fool me.
  Love me, love me,
  Pretend that you love me.
  Leave me, leave me,
  Just say that you need me.
  So I cry and I beg for you to
  Love me, love me,
  Say that you love me.
  Leave me, leave me,
  Just say that you need me.
  I can't care 'bout anything but you.
  Love me, love me (say that you love me).
  Fool me, fool me (go on and fool me).
  Love me, love me (I know that you need me).
  I can't care 'bout anything but you." </p>
