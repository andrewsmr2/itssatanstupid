<p style="color:white"> Hey, losers.  Satan here.  Time to wake up, people. Stop stalling, Sandra- up and at ‘em.  Another glorious day in the gutter.  Wake up, people.  Let’s get to it. </p>

<p style="color:white"> Today I thought I’d try something new.  So, I've been feeling a little stressed lately.  You all may think that I don’t have problems but Satan has problems, okay?  So I googled “how to be less stressed” and the internet suggested meditation.  Big surprise.  So I tried looking up guided meditations on youtube and it’s all a little positive for my liking.  So I thought to myself, “You’re a smart guy- come up with your own meditation”.  SO I DID.  I said to myself, "What makes you feel good, Satan?" and I sat on it for a bit.  And honestly- I gotta say, I really like bringing you guys down.  Like, if I can make all of you cry by 10am, it's a good day.  So, in a lot of these meditations they'll either tell you how to breathe (like, cool- I've been doing it my whole life- I think I got it) or they'll tell you to focus on the present moment and I'd rather focus on you losers.  My zen comes from bringing you idiots down a notch or 10 so let's get to it, people.  So what I want you to do, I want you to get in an uncomfortable position- maybe hunch your back to the point where you’re not sure if you can get up by yourself without some outside assistance.  I want you to tense the muscles in your face and neck.  Take really quick, shallow breaths and listen to the words I’m about to say.  They’re about you so really internalize them.  OK- cue music, DJ. </p>

 <p style="color:white"> "You are a grey sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake.  If your brain was dynamite, there wouldn't be enough to blow your hat off.  I thought of you today.  It reminded me to take out the trash.  Go back to party city, where you belong." </p>

  <p style="color:white"> Alright, people.  That’s enough of that.  So what’s new with you all?  Nothing new, I presume.  Well, I’ve got news.  So anyone who is not new around here will know that up until this point, my podcast did not have a name.  I didn’t want to name it, and I ain’t got no competition around here so if I don’t wanna name my podcast- I don’t have to name my podcast and y’all losers just have to deal with it- amirite? I’m the boss around here and I do as I damn well please and that’s just it.  That’s just simply it, my friends.  Well- that’s not simply it.  It wouldn’t be hell without some bozo telling me what to do. I have been informed by my producers that it would be easier for the graphic designer they hired to design my podcast artwork if my podcast had a name. So, you know- I’m stubborn but I’m not that stubborn, so I said “alright, I’ll name the damn podcast”.  And I've been racking my brain trying to think of a name for this podcast but nothing felt right.  So I was like, "Okay, Satan- what are you passionate about?"  I said "don't force it, Satan.  Just let it flow".  And I thought of Britney Spears.  I can't tell you what made me think of Britney Spears but I thought of Britney Spears.  I thought of Britney Spears, but only through the imageless words of "It's Britney, bitch" arising from the blackness of my brain.  And I gotta say, I know it's very trendy right now to like Britney Spears but I was around in the late 90s/early 2000s and I mean, there's a reason why people consider her to be a pop princess.  I like Britney, I do.  I actually tried really hard to get Britney to cross over to the dark side, all of 2007 I was trying so hard to get Britney to cross over to the dark side.  But she did tell us that she is "stronger" (via the "Oops I did it again album") and I don't know, I guess I should have listened to her.  Here's to believing women, I guess.  So like I said, I thought of Britney via the imageless words of "It's Britney, bitch" that came out of the pitch black darkness of my brain and then I thought "... It's Satan, stupid".  It’s Satan, stupid! So that’s the name of my podcast, spread it around like the wildfires blazin' outside your windows. “It’s Satan, stupid”.  I could say it all day. </p>

  <p style="color:white">     Anywho.  Some of the newcomers have wasted no time in sending me e-mails and honestly, it’s a little annoying, people.  I’m a busy broad but let’s knock a couple of these out- I will verbally respond to a few e-mails right here and now, let’s get to it.  Kendra- I hear you.  Your feet hurt, your hips hurt, your back hurts.  Everything hurts.  Boohoo.  We get it.  That’s what happens when you come to hell.  Everybody else is experiencing the same thing- it’s called chronic pain and it’s a thing here, babes.  You best get used to it. But since you’ve been feeling the need to bombard me via e-mail incessantly, I’ll send you to a doctor.  He’s going to mansplain all of your symptoms, dismiss you as being dramatic and send you a bill for $300.  But since you don’t have any money (because you don’t have a JOB), we will send a demon to cut off your right foot and use it as currency.  Hey- then you’ll only have one foot that’s bothering you!  Suck it up, toots.  Alright, next e-mail.  Bernadette- the television remote is not broken.  They’re mostly for decoration.  And to give you the illusion of control until you realize you have no control over anything.  I mean, I’ve given you all televisions, you’d think that one would be gracious.  And I do switch it up for you every day.  We got fox news in the morning and we got true crime at night.  Would you like less variety and to just have fox news all day?  Because I can make that happen, people.  Actually that’s not a bad idea- because sometimes all the fox news makes people go a little bonkers and I like to be entertained.  Alright, I’m sick of this, to everyone else who has e-mailed me- you’re stressing me out, stop it. </p>

    <p style="color:white"> Alright, that’s it for today, people.  As you know, I have had Britney on the brain and in celebration of me naming my podcast, I figure it’s only fair to pay homage to the woman who served me my inspiration.  So, today I’ll be singing “work, bitch”.  It's a classic and if you don't think so, you can go to hell. Whoops, you're already here, my bad. Cue music, DJ. </p>

    <p style="color:white"> You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work, bitch.
You want a Lamborghini? Sippin’ martinis?
Look hot in a bikini? You better work, bitch.
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work, bitch. You better work, bitch.
You better work, bitch. You better work, bitch.
Now get to work, bitch! (Ah-ah)
Now get to work, bitch! (Ah-ah)
Bring it on, ring the alarm.
Don’t stop now, just be the champion.
Work it hard, like it’s your profession.
Watch out now, 'cause here it comes.
Here comes the smasher, here comes the master.
Here comes the big beat, big beat disaster.
No time to quit now, just time to get it now.
Pick up what I’m putting down.
Pick up what I’m putting down.
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work, bitch.
You want a Lamborghini? Sippin’ martinis?
Look hot in a bikini? You better work, bitch.
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work, bitch. You better work, bitch.
You better work, bitch. You better work, bitch.
Now get to work, bitch! (Ah-ah).
Now get to work, bitch! (Ah-ah).
Break it off, break it down.
See me come and you can hear my sound.
Tell somebody in your town.
Spread the word, spread the word.
Go call the police, go call the governor.
I bring the treble, don’t mean to trouble ya.
I make the governor, call me the governor.
I am the bad bitch, the bitch that you’ll never know.
Hold your head high, fingers to the sky.
They gonna try to try ya, but they can’t deny ya.
Keep it building higher, and higher.
Keep it building higher, and higher.
So hold your head high, fingers to the sky
Now they don’t believe ya, but they gonna need ya..
Keep it moving higher, and higher.
Keep it moving higher, and higher and higher.
Work, work, work, work.
Work, work, work, work.
Work (work), work (work), work, work.
Work (work), work, work (work), work.
Work it out (work it out), work it out, work it out (work it out), work it out.
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out.
Work it out (work it out), work it out, work it out (work it out), work it out.
Work it out (work it out), work it out.
You better work, bitch.
You better work, bitch.“ </p>
